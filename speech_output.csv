This act, which now moves to President Trump's desk, represents a significant breakthrough for crypto entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers alike.

Paul S. Atkins, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), lauded the diligent efforts of both the House and Senate in facilitating this crucial legislation. He specifically recognized the contributions of Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill, and Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bill Hagerty for their leadership and dedication in bringing this initiative to fruition.

The GENIUS Act aims to clarify regulations surrounding payment stablecoins, enabling innovators to navigate the complex landscape of financial technology with clearer guidelines.

$H 250718-speech-www,Acting Chair Feldman Compromises Child Safety by Stalling Water Bead Regulation,"WASHINGTON, July 18 -- In a shocking move, the Acting Chair of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Peter Feldman, has blocked the implementation of a crucial safety rule intended to protect children from the dangers posed by water beads. This decision, announced on July 16, 2025, is raising alarms among consumer advocates and safety officials who emphasize that water beads, often found in children's toys, present severe risks of choking and internal injury.

Commissioner Richard Trumka issued a statement highlighting the severity of this inaction, pointing out that water beads can expand in a child's body, resulting in life-threatening blockages of the digestive and respiratory tracts. The cancellation of the anticipated safety rule not only puts children at greater risk but also silences consumer voices who have shared tragic accounts related to water bead incidents.

The failure to finalize this safety measure is compounded by Feldman's decision to cancel the priorities hearing, effectively stifling discussions around urgent safety issues. This cancellation, viewed as a violation of agency directives, leaves families vulnerable while critical safety laws remain unaddressed.

Trumka's statement draws attention to a troubling pattern of obstructing progress on child safety matters, referencing a similar stall on legislation regarding button batteries in toys just a week prior. He expressed unwavering concern for the well-being of American families, emphasizing that children's safety cannot be compromised by bureaucratic inertia.

The time for action is now. Acting Chair Feldman must prioritize consumer safety and take decisive steps to protect our children from unnecessary hazards, declared Trumka. The implications of these safety regulations are enormous, and stakeholders call upon the CPSC leadership to act swiftly in the best interest of public health and safety. Families in the U.S. deserve better, and lives depend on it.

$H 250718-speech-www, CMS Proposed Rule Promises Significant Savings in Health Care Costs for Medicare Patients,"WASHINGTON, July 18 -- Washington, D.C. (July 17, 2025) - The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has unveiled a groundbreaking proposed rule that aims to substantially lower healthcare costs for Medicare patients and taxpayers. In a statement, Mark E. Miller, executive vice president of health care at Arnold Ventures, emphasized that this initiative not only seeks to enhance financial accessibility for patients but also addresses essential issues within the healthcare system.

According to Miller, the proposal introduces vital changes by emphasizing site-neutral payments for drug administration, thereby taking a significant step toward curbing rising healthcare expenditures that place undue burdens on American families. He stated, These policies help protect patients from unfair billing practices, where costs for the same routine services can vary drastically based on the location the patient receives care.

The proposed reforms signal a critical shift in how healthcare services are billed and compensated, which could lead to potential savings reaching billions of dollars. With this initiative, CMS aims to reduce incentives for provider consolidation, a trend that historically drives up costs for employer-provided insurance.

Miller commended the administration for its proactive stance, expressing optimism about collaboration with Congress to solidify comprehensive site-neutral payment and billing transparency reforms. He noted, These reforms are long overdue, and we commend the administration for taking action to make them a reality.

Arnold Ventures continues to advocate for evidence-based solutions to significant societal challenges, actively working on systemic improvements in health care, education, and criminal justice since its inception in 2008. As the organization looks ahead, it remains committed to fostering sustainable change to improve the lives of American families and enhance community resilience.

$H 250718-speech-ourfinancialsecurity,,"WASHINGTON, July 18 -- Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress Condemn House Legislation Favoring Exploitive Crypto Practices

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: July 17, 2025

CONTACT: Jarice Thompson, jarice@ourfinancialsecurity.org

Washington, DC - In a stark response to the recent House passage of legislation favoring the cryptocurrency industry, Mark Hays, Associate Director for Cryptocurrency and Financial Technology at Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, delivered a clarion call warning of the dire implications for small investors and the broader financial system.

Hays expressed grave concerns regarding the profligate political spending by the crypto industry, emphasizing that the moves towards a more lenient regulatory framework jeopardize consumer protections while legitimizing a marketplace rife with scandals and financial instability. Today's House votes signal a troubling future, where the interests of the crypto industry overshadow those of hardworking Americans, Hays stated. 

Highlighting the consequences of this legislation, he articulated that untethered political spending is leading to rubber-stamped policies that prioritize corporate profits over consumer security. It is unconscionable that Congress would pass bills that do not impose meaningful restrictions on the financial dealings of individuals like Trump, enabling a cycle of legalized corruption that could expose countless Americans to financial ruin, he added.

As the CLARITY Act progresses to the Senate, Hays urged senators to reflect on the historical parallels with the deregulation efforts of the late 1990s that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis. Senators must decide if they will protect consumer rights or allow themselves to be complicit in a new wave of corrupt practices within the cryptocurrency sector, he warned.

With escalating stakes for the integrity of the financial system, Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress are calling for transparency, accountability, and a commitment to genuine consumer protection in the face of mounting pressures from the crypto lobby.

$H 250718-speech-cei,U.S. Stands Firm Against EU Overregulation: A Call for Fair Trade Practices,"WASHINGTON, July 18 -- In a strong message to the European Union, prominent leaders from the Competitive Enterprise Institute and other advocacy organizations have applauded President Trump for taking decisive action against the discriminatory Digital Services Tax (DST) imposed by Canada. This movement is seen as a crucial measure to safeguard American innovators from unfair treatment by foreign governments that aim to exploit U.S. companies for their economic benefit.

The letter to President Trump highlights the long-standing issue of the EU's overregulation and its detrimental effect on American technology firms, which have faced significant antitrust fines under the EU's Digital Markets Act. Prominent corporate players, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, have been subjected to severe penalties, which restrict their operational capacity and competitiveness not only within Europe but worldwide.

As negotiations with the EU unfold, the signatories urge President Trump to secure commitments from Europe to halt discriminative practices that threaten U.S. tech companies. They express concern that the EU views American technological prowess as a source for funding their welfare systems, rather than as an innovative and competitive sector deserving protection and support.

With European officials seemingly unwilling to engage on these issues, the letter emphasizes the need for renewed U.S. leadership in trade dialogues. The leaders assert that without a firm government response, the EU will continue to target American innovators, ultimately weakening the U.S. competitive edge while enabling the rise of Chinese tech companies.

As the U.S. braces for upcoming trade discussions, the coalition stands ready to back efforts that honor American ingenuity and foster a healthier digital marketplace, marking a potential resurgence in techno-economic leadership for the United States.
